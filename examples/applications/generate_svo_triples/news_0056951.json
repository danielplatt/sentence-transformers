This result includes non-cash foreign currency translation gains on deferred tax liabilities of $6.7 million ($0.03 per share), mark-to-market adjustments and derivative gains on financial instruments of $0.5 million (nil per share) and non-cash foreign currency translation gains of $3.5 million ($0.01 per share). Excluding these items would result in adjusted net income 1 of $34.2 million or $0.15 per share for the first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income of $76.0 million or $0.33 per share.\nIncluded in the first quarter of 2018 net income and not adjusted above is non-cash stock option expense of $7.8 million ($0.03 per share).\nIn the first quarter of 2018, cash provided by operating activities decreased by 7% to $207.7 million ($180.5 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital), compared with cash provided by operating activities of $222.6 million in the first quarter of 2017 ($224.7 million before changes in non-cash components of working capital). The decrease in cash provided by operating activities before changes in non-cash components of working capital during the current period was mainly due to lower gold sales volumes and higher costs, partially offset by higher realized gold prices. The higher costs were primarily a result of the strengthening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar and higher costs at several operations, principally at Meadowbank.\n\"Our operations continued to deliver strong cash flow in the first quarter with unit production costs on the lower end of full year guidance and gold production tracking slightly above full year guidance. We remain focused on optimizing unit costs and increasing production as we transition through 2018 and begin to see the positive results of our growth phase in 2019\", said Sean Boyd, Agnico Eagle's Chief Executive Officer. \"During the first quarter, we continued to make very good progress at our Nunavut growth projects, with Amaruq permitting activities advancing as expected and development of the underground exploration ramp proceeding as planned. Construction activities and underground development remain on schedule and on budget at Meliadine\", added Mr. Boyd.\n1 Adjusted net income is a Non-GAAP measure. For a discussion regarding the Company's use of non-GAAP measures, please see \"Note Regarding Certain Measures of Performance\".\nFirst quarter 2018 highlights include:\nSolid operational performance – Payable gold production 2 in the first quarter of 2018 was 389,278 ounces at production costs per ounce of $759, total cash costs 3 per ounce of $648 and all-in sustaining costs per ounce 4 (\"AISC\") of $889\nProduction and cost guidance reiterated for 2018 – Full year production guidance is unchanged at 1.53 million ounces of gold at total cash costs per ounce of $625 to $675 and AISC of $890 to $940 per ounce.\nNunavut development projects progressing on schedule and on budget – Amaruq permitting is on track for approval in the second quarter of 2018 and the underground exploration ramp is proceeding as planned. Meliadine construction and development is progressing well and procurement activities for the 2018 barge season are now complete\nInfill drilling at the East Malartic property yields favourable results, potential development options under review – Recent drilling at East Malartic has returned significant intersections of 2.5 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold over 37.7 metres at 238 metres depth, including 3.6 g/t gold over 10.6 metres. Studies are underway to evaluate potential mining scenarios at both East Malartic and the neighbouring Odyssey project. Permitting activities to provide ramp access to both projects are currently underway\nAcquisition of Yamana Gold Inc.'s (\"Yamana\") 50% interest in the Canadian exploration assets of Canadian Malartic Corporation (\"CMC\") completed in late March 2018 – Agnico Eagle now owns the exploration assets of CMC, which include the Kirkland Lake and Hammond Reef projects. At Kirkland Lake, a 25,700 metre drill program will be carried out in 2018 to further evaluate known deposits and test new target areas\nMonetization of non-core assets – The Company is assessing opportunities to monetize non-core assets, including the West Pequop Joint Venture, Summit and PQX properties in Nevada, the Cobalt mining properties in the historic Cobalt silver district in Ontario, and its equity investment in Belo Sun Mining Corp. (\"Belo Sun\") which it disposed of this month as previously announced\nA quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share was declared\n2 Payable production of a mineral means the quantity of a mineral produced during a period contained in products that have been or will be sold by the Company whether such products are shipped during the period or held as inventory at the end of the period.\n3 Total cash costs per ounce is a Non-GAAP measure and, unless otherwise specified, is reported on a by-product basis. For a reconciliation to production costs and for total cash costs on a co-product basis, see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" below. See also \"Note Regarding Certain Measures of Performance\".\n4 All-in-sustaining costs per ounce is a Non-GAAP measure and, unless otherwise specified, is reported on a by-product basis. For a reconciliation to production costs and for all-in sustaining costs on a co-product basis, see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" below. See also \"Note Regarding Certain Measures of Performance\".\nFirst Quarter Financial and Production Highlights\nIn the first quarter of 2018, stable operational performance continued at the Company's mines, which led to payable gold production of 389,278 ounces, compared to 418,216 ounces in the first quarter of 2017. This lower level of production in the 2018 period was primarily due to reduced throughput levels at Meadowbank as the mine transitions through the last full year of mining at site and at Lapa as mill processing did not resume until March 2018. A detailed description of the production of each mine is set out below.\nProduction costs per ounce for the first quarter of 2018 were $759, compared to $578 for the first quarter of 2017. Total cash costs per ounce for the first quarter of 2018 were $648, compared to $539 for the first quarter of 2017. Production costs per ounce and total cash costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 were affected by lower gold production levels at Meadowbank and Lapa, the strengthening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar and higher costs at several mines (principally at Meadowbank) compared to the first quarter of 2017. The impact of the strengthening of the local currencies was approximately $40 per ounce.\nAISC for the first quarter of 2018 were $889, compared to $741 for the first quarter of 2017. The higher AISC is primarily due to expected lower gold production and higher total cash costs per ounce compared to the first quarter of 2017. A detailed description of the cost performance of each mine is set out below.\nCash Position Remains Strong\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased to $464.8 million at March 31, 2018, from the December 31, 2017 balance of $643.9 million due to the ongoing investment in the Company's growth projects and the recent acquisition of the Kirkland Lake and Hammond Reef projects.\nThe outstanding balance on the Company's credit facility remained nil at March 31, 2018. This results in available credit lines of approximately $1.2 billion, not including the uncommitted $300 million accordion feature.\nSubsequent to the quarter end, on April 5, 2018, the Company issued notes to certain institutional investors totalling $350 million. The notes consist of $45 million at 4.38% due 2028, $55 million at 4.48% due 2030 and $250 million at 4.63% due 2033. The terms of the notes are substantially the same as the terms of the outstanding notes of the Company. The Company previously announced its intention to issue these notes in its news release dated February 14, 2018.\nApproximately 40% of the Company's remaining 2018 Canadian dollar exposure is hedged at an average floor price of 1.28 C$/US$, of which about one third are designated for capital expenditures at Meliadine. Approximately 10% of the Company's remaining 2018 Mexican peso exposure is hedged at an average floor price of 19.00 MXN/US$. The Company's remaining 2018 Euro exposure is currently unhedged. The Company's full year 2018 cost guidance was based on assumed exchange rates of 1.25 C$/US$ and 18.0 MXN/US$. Agnico Eagle anticipates adding to its operating currency hedges, pending market conditions.\nMonetization of Non-Core Assets\nThe Company has been assessing the opportunity to monetize several non-core assets in its portfolio, including the West Pequop Joint Venture, Summit and PQX properties in Nevada, the Cobalt mining properties in the historic Cobalt silver district in Ontario and its equity investment in Belo Sun which it disposed of this month.\nWest Pequop Joint Venture, Summit and PQX Properties\nThe Company has entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corp (\"Newmont\"), whereby Newmont will purchase Agnico Eagle's 51% interest in the West Pequop Joint Venture, and the Company's 100% interest in the Summit and PQX properties in northeastern Nevada (collectively, the \"Nevada Properties\"). The Nevada Properties are adjacent to Newmont's Long Canyon mine.\nUnder the purchase and sale agreement, the Company will receive a cash payment of $35 million and be granted a 0.8% net smelter return (\"NSR\") royalty on the Nevada Properties held by the West Pequop Joint Venture and a 1.6% NSR on the Summit and PQX properties. The sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nCobalt Mining Properties\nIn the mid-1950's, five mining companies merged to become Cobalt Consolidated Mining Company (\"CCMC\"), one of the predecessors to Agnico Eagle. CCMC and, later, Agnico Eagle operated 25 mines in the Cobalt area and produced approximately 30 million ounces of silver and 3.2 million pounds of cobalt between 1957 and 1989.\nThe Company currently has two sizeable land packages in the Cobalt region, the Coleman property (178 claims covering approximately 1,750 hectares) and the South Lorrain Property (37 claims covering approximately 350 hectares).\nThe Company has initiated a strategic review of its Cobalt properties with the intent to realize value for the historical property portfolio. The Company expects that the outcome of such review may result in the sale of all or a portion of its Cobalt properties.\nDisposition of Investment in Belo Sun\nThe Company reviews its portfolio of equity investments in junior mining companies on an ongoing basis. As previously announced, the Company has disposed of 44,551,000 common shares of Belo Sun for aggregate proceeds of C$14,924,585. For further details, please see the Company's new release dated April 20, 2018.\nCapital Expenditures\nTotal capital expenditures (including sustaining capital) in 2018 remain forecast to be approximately $1.08 billion.

These mines are located within 50 kilometres of each other, which provides operating synergies and allows for the sharing of technical expertise.\nLaRonde Mine – Higher Grades Drive Strong First Quarter Performance as the Mine Enters its Thirtieth Year of Production\nThe 100% owned LaRonde mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in 1988.\nLaRonde Mine - Operating Statistics\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nTonnes of ore milled (thousands of tonnes)\n531\n559\nTonnes of ore milled per day\n5,901\n6,215\nGold grade (g/t)\n5.49\n4.61\nGold production (ounces)\n89,785\n78,912\nProduction costs per tonne (C$)\n$\n155\n$\n106\nMinesite costs per tonne (C$)\n$\n121\n$\n109\nProduction costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n723\n$\n562\nTotal cash costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n427\n$\n464\nProduction costs per tonne in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to higher underground and mill maintenance costs, lower throughput and the timing of unsold inventory. Production costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to the reasons described above and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar between periods, partially offset by higher gold production. For the remainder of the year, grades are expected to be more in line with 2018 guidance and mill throughput is expected to increase from levels seen in the first quarter of 2018.\nMinesite costs per tonne 5 in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to lower throughput levels and higher underground and mill maintenance costs. Minesite costs per tonne are expected to be in line with guidance over the balance of 2018. Total cash costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 decreased when compared to the prior-year period due to higher gold production and higher by-product metal revenues.\nGold production in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to higher grades resulting from the mining sequence in the lower part of the mine.\nAt the LaRonde 3 project, conversion and exploration drilling is ongoing at depth as the Company continues to evaluate a phased approach to development between the 311 level (a depth of 3.1 kilometres) and the 350 level (a depth of 3.5 kilometres). Under this phased approach, an additional two or three levels will be developed per year in either the east or west areas of the mine through 2022. This is expected to result in the conversion of approximately 1.2 million ounces of mineral resources into mineral reserves, with full mining activities to commence in 2022. The Company believes that this phased approach is a lower risk, less capital intensive option for developing the deeper levels of the LaRonde mine.\n5 Minesite costs per tonne is a Non-GAAP measure. For a reconciliation of this measure to production costs, see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" below. See also \"Note Regarding Certain Measures of Performance\".\nLaRonde Zone 5 – Commercial Production Remains on Schedule for Early Third Quarter 2018\nIn 2003, the Company acquired the LaRonde Zone 5 project from Barrick Gold Corporation. The property lies adjacent to and west of the LaRonde mining complex and previous operators exploited the deposit by open pit. In February 2017, LaRonde Zone 5 was approved by Agnico Eagle's Board of Directors for development.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, development of the first five mining stopes was essentially completed and the first production blast is expected in early May 2018. The paste plant is expected to be commissioned in the second quarter of 2018. The development of LaRonde Zone 5 is on budget and on schedule with commercial production on schedule for early in the third quarter of 2018. For additional details on the project see the Company's news release dated February 15, 2017.\nCanadian Malartic Mine – Record Quarterly Gold Production; First Drill Results Reported for East Malartic Project\nIn June 2014, Agnico Eagle and Yamana acquired Osisko Mining Corporation and created the Canadian Malartic General Partnership (the \"Partnership\"). The Partnership owns and operates the Canadian Malartic mine in northwestern Quebec through a joint management committee. Each of Agnico Eagle and Yamana has an indirect 50% ownership interest in the Partnership. All volume numbers in this section reflect the Company's 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic mine, except as noted.\nCanadian Malartic Mine - Operating Statistics\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nTonnes of ore milled (thousands of tonnes)\n2,510\n2,433\nTonnes of ore milled per day\n27,888\n27,029\nGold grade (g/t)\n1.17\n1.03\nGold production (ounces)\n83,403\n71,382\nProduction costs per tonne (C$)\n$\n24\n$\n18\nMinesite costs per tonne (C$)\n$\n25\n$\n22\nProduction costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n567\n$\n455\nTotal cash costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n566\n$\n556\nProduction costs per tonne in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period primarily due to higher contractor and fuel costs and the timing of unsold inventory, partially offset by higher throughput. Production costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to the reasons described above and the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar between periods, partially offset by higher production.\nMinesite costs per tonne in the first quarter of 2018 were higher when compared to the prior-year period due to the reasons described above. Total cash costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 were higher when compared to the prior-year period due to the reasons described above, partially offset by higher production.\nGold production in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to higher throughput and higher grades.\nThe Barnat extension project continues to progress on schedule and on budget. Since the beginning of the first quarter of 2018, the following activities have been undertaken:\nConstruction of the temporary bridge which became operational in January 2018 Ongoing overburden stripping and overload (new road bed foundation) preparation Backfill of the historically mined Buckshot pit was essentially completed\nProduction activities at Barnat are scheduled to begin in late 2019.\nInfill Drilling at Odyssey Confirms Resource Grade; First Drill Results Reported from the East Malartic Zone\nAt the Canadian Malartic mine, exploration programs are ongoing to evaluate a number of near pit and underground targets. In addition, the Partnership is exploring the East Malartic and the Odyssey properties, which are located to the east of the Canadian Malartic open pit. These opportunities have the potential to provide new sources of ore for the Canadian Malartic mill.\nThe 2018 exploration program will consist of 140,000 metres of drilling with a budgeted cost (50% basis) of $8.6 million, including 80,000 metres for valuation in the upper and middle parts of the East Malartic Zone. There are currently three drill rigs at the East Malartic project and six rigs at the Odyssey project. In the first quarter of 2018, 22,089 metres of drilling (46 holes) were completed at the Odyssey project and 13,600 metres (18 holes) were completed at the East Malartic project.\nOdyssey Zone\nThe Odyssey Zone lies on the east side of the Canadian Malartic property, approximately 3.0 kilometres east of the current limit of the Canadian Malartic open pit. Exploration results from the Odyssey Zone were last reported in the Company's news release dated February 15, 2017.\nThe Odyssey Zone is composed of multiple mineralized bodies spatially associated with a porphyritic intrusion close to the contact of the Pontiac Group sediments and the Piché Group of volcanic rocks. They are grouped into two parallel elongated sheets, the Odyssey North and Odyssey South zones approximately 500 metres apart, which strike east-southeast and dip steeply south. The Odyssey North Zone plunges shallowly to the east and has been traced from a depth of 600 to 1,400 metres below surface along a strike length of approximately 1.3 kilometres. The Odyssey South Zone has been located between approximately 200 and 550 metres below surface over a strike length of 1.2 kilometres.\nInitial indicated mineral resources for the Odyssey Zone are estimated at 9,000 ounces of gold (108,000 tonnes grading 2.45 g/t gold), while inferred mineral resources for the Odyssey Zone are estimated at 838,000 ounces of gold (11.2 million tonnes grading 2.32 g/t gold) as of December 31, 2017. All mineral resources are on a 50% basis.\nSelected recent drill intercepts from the Odyssey South Zone are set out in the table below. The drill-hole collars are located on the Canadian Malartic and Odyssey local geology map, and the pierce points are shown on the composite longitudinal section. The intercepts reported for the Odyssey South Zone show uncapped and capped grades over estimated true widths, based on a preliminary geological interpretation that is being updated as new information becomes available with further drilling.\nRecent exploration drill results from the Odyssey South Zone\nDrill hole\nLocation\nFrom\n(metres)\nTo\n(metres)\nDepth of\nmidpoint\nbelow\nsurface\n(metres)\nEstimated\ntrue width\n(metres)\nGold grade\n(g/t)\n(uncapped)\nGold\ngrade (g/t)\n(capped)*\nODY17-5189\nOdyssey South\n499.0\n521.0\n427\n18.1\n2.1\n2.1\nODY17-5191\nOdyssey South\n479.7\n489.0\n421\n7.8\n2.9\n2.9\nODY18-5196\nOdyssey South\n337.2\n347.0\n270\n8.9\n7.3\n3.7\nODY18-5198\nOdyssey South\n385.7\n388.6\n273\n2.8\n39.1\n18.5\nODY18-5201\nOdyssey South\n444.0\n463.1\n319\n18.2\n2.2\n2.2\nODY18-5202\nOdyssey South\n410.4\n420.5\n369\n8.3\n2.4\n2.4\nODY18-5207\nOdyssey South\n319.0\n339.2\n241\n18.8\n2.5\n2.5\nODY18-5218\nOdyssey South\n448.6\n453.0\n379\n3.9\n2.5\n2.5\nand\nOdyssey South\n462.0\n469.5\n391\n6.7\n2.9\n2.9\nODY18-5219\nOdyssey South\n455.5\n466.5\n399\n9.5\n2.4\n2.4\nODY18-5221\nOdyssey South\n367.5\n374.8\n271\n6.9\n3.6\n3.6\n*\nResults from the Odyssey Zone use a capping factor of 20 g/t gold.\n[Canadian Malartic and Odyssey Local Geology Map]\n[Canadian Malartic and Odyssey Composite Longitudinal Section]\nExploration is currently focusing on infilling the near-surface portion of the deposit in Odyssey South. Recent drilling on the Odyssey South Zone returned several significant intersections that confirm its geological setting apart from the current mineral resource area, confirm the grade of the mineral resources and suggest that the size of the zone could increase. On the eastern side of the Odyssey South Zone, hole ODY18-5196 intersected 3.7 g/t gold over 8.9 metres at 270 metres depth and hole ODY18-5201 intersected 2.2 g/t gold over 18.2 metres at 319 metres depth. There are several recent intercepts in the central part of the Odyssey South Zone, including hole ODY18-5207 that intersected 2.5 g/t gold over 18.8 metres at 241 metres depth and hole ODY17-5191 that intersected 2.9 g/t gold over 7.8 metres at 421 metres depth. A further 360 metres to the west, hole ODY18-5198 intersected 18.5 g/t gold over 2.8 metres at 273 metres depth.\nAnother 410 metres to the west, well away from the current mineral resources, hole ODY18-5202 intersected 2.4 g/t gold over 8.3 metres at 369 metres depth.\nRecent drilling at Odyssey has confirmed the mineral resources tonnage and grade in the central portion of the zone, and has extended the zone along strike and closer to surface. Definition and expansion drilling will continue in the coming quarters to increase confidence in the grade and zone geometry.\nEast Malartic\nIn 2017, an initial inferred mineral resource was declared on the East Malartic property, which was previously a gold producing property. The East Malartic property is located directly adjacent to and east of the Canadian Malartic Mine, and west of the Odyssey Zone. Inferred mineral resources at East Malartic (on a 50% basis) are estimated at 1.2 million ounces of gold (19.0 million tonnes grading 2.02 g/t gold) to a depth of 1,000 metres. This is the first report of exploration drill results from the East Malartic property in a Company news release.\nAt the East Malartic project, the Partnership is exploring three mineralized zones with distinct geology that come together beneath and to the east of the Canadian Malartic open pit. The East Malartic and Sladen zones are intertwined, extending from beneath the open pit eastward to beneath the Odyssey North Zone, while the Sheehan Zone lies immediately north of East Malartic and Sladen in a shear zone including porphyritic intrusives and ultramafic volcanic rocks. Both the East Malartic and Sladen zones are related to the Sladen fault that also includes Canadian Malartic mineralization (to the west) and the Odyssey North Zone (to the east). The Sladen fault is at least 5 kilometres long, and hosts most of the mineralization at the Canadian Malartic, Sladen, East Malartic mines and Odyssey zones.\nDuring 2017, exploration drilling at the East Malartic project included 59,000 metres (63 holes) of diamond drilling.\nSelected drill intercepts from the 2017 drill program at the East Malartic project are set out in the table below. The drill-hole collars are located on the Canadian Malartic and Odyssey local geology map, and the pierce points are shown on the composite longitudinal section. The intercepts reported for the East Malartic project show uncapped and capped grades over estimated true widths, based on a preliminary geological interpretation that is being updated as new information becomes available with further drilling.\nRecent exploration drill results from the East Malartic project\nDrill Hole\nZone\nFrom\n(metres)\nTo\n(metres)\nDepth of\nmidpoint\nbelow\nsurface\n(metres)\nEstimated\ntrue width\n(metres)\nGold grade\n(g/t)\n(uncapped)\nGold\ngrade (g/t)\n(capped)*\nMEV17-001\nSladen\n866.0\n871.0\n770\n2.7\n2.8\n2.8\nand\nSladen\n901.7\n914.0\n803\n6.7\n2.8\n2.8\nMEV17-012A\nSheehan\n440.0\n451.2\n360\n7.9\n3.3\n3.3\nincluding\n445.0\n449.0\n361\n2.8\n6.4\n6.4\nand\nEast Malartic\n587.0\n595.0\n475\n3.2\n3.9\n3.9\nincluding\n587.0\n592.2\n474\n2.1\n5.2\n5.2\nMEV17-016A\nSladen\n527.0\n560.0\n476\n23.9\n3.2\n3.2\nincluding\n546.3\n552.1\n482\n4.1\n8.8\n8.8\nMEV17-024\nEast Malartic\n272.8\n334.0\n238\n37.7\n2.5\n2.5\nincluding\n272.8\n290.0\n225\n10.6\n3.6\n3.6\nincluding\n326.6\n334.0\n264\n4.6\n7.1\n7.1\nand\nSheehan\n414.2\n425.2\n336\n3.7\n2.7\n2.7\nand\nSheehan\n436.6\n463.0\n359\n8.6\n2.2\n2.2\nand\nSheehan\n477.0\n486.4\n384\n2.9\n2.6\n2.6\nand\nSheehan\n534.0\n562.4\n438\n8.6\n2.5\n2.5\nMEV17-EA-\n2002WA\nEast Malartic\n1065.0\n1093.9\n962\n18.0\n2.2\n2.2\nMEV17-EA-2004\nSheehan\n488.0\n533.3\n427\n31.9\n10.2\n7.4\nincluding\n520.9\n533.3\n441\n8.9\n27.3\n16.8\nand\nEast Malartic\n677.2\n689.8\n568\n5.7\n2.0\n2.0\nMEV17-SH-1005\nSheehan\n472.0\n501.0\n338\n21.2\n3.5\n3.5\nincluding\n472.0\n480.0\n330\n5.8\n9.5\n9.5\n*\nResults from the Sheehan and East Malartic zones use a capping factor of 40 g/t gold. Results from Sladen use a\ncapping factor of 30 g/t gold.\nAmong the most promising intercepts in the Sheehan Zone from the 2017 drill program, hole MEV17-EA-2004 intersected 7.4 g/t gold over 31.9 metres at 427 metres depth, including 16.8 g/t gold over 8.9 metres. Approximately 800 metres to the east, hole MEV17-SH-1005 intersected 3.5 g/t gold over 21.2 metres at 338 metres depth, including 9.5 g/t gold over 5.8 metres, also in the Sheehan Zone.\nIn the East Malartic and Sladen zones, there were also promising results in 2017. Hole MEV17-024 intersected 2.5 g/t gold over 37.7 metres at 238 metres depth, including 3.6 g/t gold over 10.6 metres, and separately including 7.1 g/t gold over 4.6 metres, in the East Malartic Zone. Approximately 500 metres to the southwest in the Sladen Zone, hole MEV17-016A intersected 3.2 g/t gold over 23.9 metres at 476 metres depth, including 8.8 g/t gold over 4.1 metres. At greater depths, the Sladen Zone was intersected by hole MEV17-001, yielding 2.8 g/t gold over 6.7 metres at 803 metres depth. Approximately 1,100 metres to the east, hole MEV17-EA-2002WA intersected the East Malartic Zone, yielding 2.2 g/t gold over 18.0 metres at 962 metres depth.\nIn 2018, the exploration focus will be to convert inferred mineral resources to indicated mineral resources in the shallower portions of the Odyssey South and East Malartic zones and further drilling to better define the geometry of the higher-grade internal zones at the Odyssey Zone.\nIn addition, permitting activities are underway for an exploration ramp to provide underground access to the shallower portions of the Odyssey South and East Malartic zones. Development of the ramp, which will provide access for underground drilling and collection of a bulk sample, is expected to begin in late 2018. The goal of the underground development program is to provide higher grade feed to the Canadian Malartic mill and extend the current mine life.\nKirkland Lake Project Update\nOn March 28, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Yamana's indirect 50% interest in the Canadian exploration assets of CMC. As a result, Agnico Eagle now owns the transferred CMC exploration assets, which include the Kirkland Lake and Hammond Reef projects. The Company previously announced the entering into of an asset purchase agreement for the Canadian exploration assets of CMC in its news release dated December 21, 2017.\nThe Hammond Reef project in northwestern Ontario covers approximately 31,145 hectares and contains open pit measured and indicated mineral resources of 4.5 million ounces gold (208.4 million tonnes at 0.67 g/t gold) and open pit inferred mineral resources of 12,000 ounces gold (0.5 million tonnes at 0.74 g/t gold). Mineral resources are estimated as of December 31, 2017 and are reported on a 100% basis. For a detailed breakdown of mineral resources, please refer to the Company's press release dated February 14, 2018.\nThe Kirkland Lake project in northeastern Ontario covers approximately 27,312 hectares and mineral reserves and mineral resources have been outlined on several properties. Deposits in the Kirkland Lake area include: Upper Beaver, Anoki and McBean, Amalgamated Kirkland, Upper Canada and Munro. The primary deposits on the Kirkland Lake property are outlined on the plan map shown below.\n[Kirkland Lake Property Regional Geology Map]\nAt Kirkland Lake, an initial $5 million exploration program consisting of 25,700 metres of drilling is planned for 2018. The primary exploration focus for the Kirkland Lake project this year will be:\nExpanding and locating new gold mineralization on the Upper Beaver and Upper Canada properties Prospecting along the Larder-Cadillac Deformation Zone Completing a technical review of all exploration data for the Upper Beaver deposit in order to determine the next steps at the property, including the evaluation of potential synergies between Upper Beaver and Upper Canada\nThe Upper Beaver deposit is atypical of the Kirkland Lake - Larder Lake mining district. Gold-copper mineralization is predominantly hosted in an alkalic intrusive complex and is associated with disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite and magnetite-sulphide veining.\nThe Upper Beaver deposit contains underground mineral reserves of 1.4 million ounces of gold and 20,000 tonnes of copper (8.0 million tonnes grading 5.43 g/t gold and 0.25% copper), underground measured and indicated mineral resources of 0.4 million ounces of gold and 5,100 tonnes of copper (3.6 million tonnes grading 3.45 g/t gold and 0.14% copper) and underground inferred mineral resources of 1.4 million ounces of gold and 17,300 tonnes of copper (8.7 million tonnes grading 5.07 g/t gold and 0.20% copper). Mineral reserves and mineral resources are estimated as of December 31, 2017 and are reported on a 100% basis. For a detailed breakdown of mineral reserves and mineral resources, please refer to the Company's press release dated February 14, 2018.\nThe exploration program at Upper Beaver in 2018 will consist of:\nNine diamond drill holes, totalling approximately 4,500 metres, designed to test shallow geophysical and soil anomalies predominantly outside of the known mineralized zones Approximately 6,000 metres of drilling (one pilot and four wedge holes) to test for down-dip, down-plunge and on strike extensions of the deep inferred mineral resource at a depth of 1,300 to 1,785 metres\nThe past-producing Upper Canada property is located approximately six kilometres southwest of the Upper Beaver property. The Upper Canada deposit, which is approximately 1.6 kilometres north of the main Larder-Cadillac Deformation Zone (\"LCDZ\"), occurs within a 300 to 400 metres wide strongly altered deformation corridor that is interpreted as a splay from the LCDZ. Host rocks are primarily volcanic tuffs and sediments that have been intruded by syenite bodies. Gold mineralization is associated with intensely altered shear zones with fine pyrite and ancillary sulfide mineralization. En-echelon higher-grade lenses are present within a broader envelope of lower grade mineralization.\nThe Upper Canada deposit contains open pit inferred mineral resources of 0.3 million ounces of gold (4.9 million tonnes grading 1.97 g/t gold) and underground inferred mineral resources of 1.4 million ounces of gold (7.2 million tonnes grading 6.22 g/t gold). Mineral resources are estimated as of December 31, 2017 and are reported on a 100% basis.\nThe exploration program at Upper Canada in 2018 will consist of:\n20 diamond drill holes, totalling approximately 6,000 metres, designed to test regional targets, including parallel structures with open pit potential Approximately 5,000 metres of near deposit drilling to test areas of known mineralization that are outside of the current inferred mineral resource envelopes\nIn addition to the drill programs at Upper Beaver and Upper Canada, approximately 1,600 metres of drilling will be carried out to test structural targets between the Upper Canada deposit and the Munro deposit. This area is thought to host the LCDZ under thick overburden cover.\nLapa – Milling Operations Re-started\nThe 100% owned Lapa mine in northwestern Quebec achieved commercial production in May 2009.\nLapa Mine - Operating Statistics\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nTonnes of ore milled (thousands of tonnes)\n17\n130\nTonnes of ore milled per day\n193\n1,439\nGold grade (g/t)\n4.01\n4.25\nGold production (ounces)\n1,722\n15,360\nProduction costs per tonne (C$)\n$\n40\n$\n133\nMinesite costs per tonne (C$)\n$\n136\n$\n134\nProduction costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n307\n$\n839\nTotal cash costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n1,056\n$\n854\nProduction costs per tonne in the first quarter of 2018 decreased when compared to the prior-year period due to the timing of unsold inventory as milling operations resumed in March 2018.

Total cash costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar between periods and lower production.\nGold production in the first quarter of 2018 decreased when compared to the prior-year period due to lower grades and recoveries.\nThe Deep 1 ramp-up continues as scheduled with average daily throughput expected to be approximately 3,500 tonnes per day in 2018 as the establishment of the mining pyramid progresses. Drilling and ramp development continues at the Deep 2 Zone.\nStudies are ongoing to evaluate the potential to increase throughput from the Deep 1 Zone and the potential to accelerate mining activities on a portion of the Deep 2 Zone, both of which could enhance production levels or extend the current mine life at Goldex and reduce operating costs.\nAt the South Zone, where gold mineralization is hosted in quartz veins, underground development is underway on two levels. The first stope in the South Zone is expected to be mined in August and there is potential to mine a total of five stopes in 2018. The South Zone is estimated to contain indicated mineral resources of 57,000 ounces of gold (432,000 tonnes grading 4.09 g/t gold) and inferred mineral resources of 169,000 ounces of gold (1.1 million tonnes grading 4.74 g/t gold).\nAgnico Eagle acquired the Akasaba West gold-copper deposit in January 2014. Located less than 30 kilometres from Goldex, the Akasaba West deposit is expected to create flexibility and synergies for the Company's operations in the Abitibi region by utilizing extra milling capacity at both Goldex and LaRonde, while reducing costs.\nThe public hearings under the Quebec environmental assessment process (Bureau des Audiences Publiques en Environnement or \"BAPE\") were completed for the Akasaba project in 2017 and the BAPE report was issued to the Quebec Minister of the Environment on June 2, 2017. The report concludes that the project is acceptable under certain conditions. Under the Federal process, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency released its Preliminary Environmental Assessment Report on the Akasaba project on February 21, 2018 for public comments. Permitting activities continue with both Provincial and Federal government agencies. Final recommendations are expected in 2018 and start-up is projected for 2020.\nNUNAVUT REGION\nAgnico Eagle has identified Nunavut as a politically attractive and stable jurisdiction with enormous geological potential. With the Company's Meadowbank mine and two significant development assets (Meliadine and the Amaruq satellite deposit at Meadowbank) and other exploration projects, Nunavut has the potential to be a strategic operating platform with the ability to generate strong production and cash flows over several decades.\nMeadowbank – Production Affected by Adverse Weather Conditions and Ore Hardness\nThe 100% owned Meadowbank mine in Nunavut, northern Canada, achieved commercial production in March 2010. The mine produced its two millionth ounce of gold in 2015.\nMeadowbank Mine - Operating Statistics\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nTonnes of ore milled (thousands of tonnes)\n830\n926\nTonnes of ore milled per day\n9,227\n10,287\nGold grade (g/t)\n2.53\n3.11\nGold production (ounces)\n61,447\n85,370\nProduction costs per tonne (C$)\n$\n94\n$\n77\nMinesite costs per tonne (C$)\n$\n88\n$\n74\nProduction costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n1,001\n$\n632\nTotal cash costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n923\n$\n590\nProduction costs per tonne in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period primarily due to lower throughput levels and the timing of unsold inventory.

Total cash costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to the reasons described above.\nGold production in the first quarter of 2018 decreased when compared to the prior-year period due to harder ore and reduced access to the pits due to adverse winter weather conditions. Gold production guidance remains unchanged at 220,000 ounces for the full year 2018.\nAmaruq Satellite Deposit – Permitting and Development Activities On Budget and Schedule for Start-up in the Third Quarter of 2019\nAgnico Eagle has a 100% interest in the Amaruq satellite deposit, approximately 50 kilometres northwest of the Meadowbank mine. Amaruq is situated on a 99,878-hectare property, almost adjacent to the 68,735-hectare Meadowbank property.\nDevelopment of the Amaruq property was approved in February 2017 by the Company's Board of Directors as a satellite deposit to supply ore to the existing Meadowbank mill, pending the receipt of the required permits. The Amaruq project was included in a National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") technical report about the Meadowbank Complex, posted on SEDAR on March 22, 2018.\nThe initial mining plan at Amaruq contemplates production of approximately 2.1 million ounces of gold between 2019 and 2024, leaving approximately 60% of the current mineral reserve and mineral resource base uncovered by the mine plan. Pre-mining activities are expected to start in 2018 at the Whale Tail deposit, which is a satellite pit that will produce ore to feed the Meadowbank mill.\nProduction is currently forecast to begin in the third quarter of 2019 (with approximately four to five months of production in 2019). Production in 2019 is expected to be between 135,000 and 190,000 ounces, with a mid-point of 162,500 ounces. In 2020, production is expected to be between 260,000 and 270,000 ounces, with a mid-point of 265,000 ounces. The Company continues to investigate additional opportunities to optimize the mine plan at Amaruq.\nOn March 15, 2018, the project certificate for the development and operation of the Whale Tail pit was received from the Nunavut Impact Review Board. Permitting activities are ongoing with the Nunavut Water Board and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans to finalize the Whale Tail Water License A and the authorization for work in aquatic habitat. The Company expects that the final approvals for the Whale Tail project will be received in the second quarter of 2018 and construction activities are projected to start in the third quarter.\nContinued Focus on Site Development Activities, Installation of the Underground Exploration Ramp and Deep Exploration in the First Quarter of 2018\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Amaruq site activities focused on:\nUnderground ramp development, which advanced by 128 metres Detailed engineering studies for Whale Tail infrastructure (52% complete) Long haul truck fleet purchases secured for 2018 and 2019 Procurement of key items for the 2018 barge season Expansion of the temporary camp facility and construction of an underground maintenance shop Approval for the expansion of the exploration road to a production haulage road – work began in April 2018\nThe first round of the underground exploration ramp was blasted in early January 2018, and at March 31, 2018, the ramp had advanced by 128 lateral metres to 29 metres vertical depth. For the full year 2018, approximately 1.2 kilometres of underground development is planned at a cost of $21 million, which will be expensed and not included in capital costs. The main purpose of building the ramp is to carry out additional exploration drilling and evaluate the potential for underground mining activities at both the Whale Tail and V zones.\nDuring the first quarter, 108 definition drill holes totaling 9,179 metres were completed to infill the first few benches of the open pit in preparation of the first year production.\nThe Amaruq project remains on budget with capital expenditures in 2018 forecast to be approximately $175 million.\nExploration continues at depth at both the Whale Tail deposit and V Zone, well below the planned pit depths. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company drilled 5,002 metres in 15 drill holes at the Amaruq project, part of the first phase of a 67,000-metre drill program in 2018. The purpose was to infill and expand the Whale Tail deposit at depth in order to define the shape of the folded mineralization in this area. Exploration results at Amaruq were last reported in the Company's news release dated February 14, 2018.\nSelected recent intercepts from the project are set out in the table below. The drill hole collars are located on the Amaruq project local geology map; the pierce points are shown on the Amaruq project composite longitudinal section. All intercepts reported for the Amaruq project show uncapped and capped grades over estimated true widths, based on a preliminary geological interpretation that is being updated as new information becomes available with further drilling.\nRecent exploration drill results from the Whale Tail (WT) deposit, Amaruq project\nDrill hole\nZone\nFrom\n(metres)\nTo\n(metres)\nDepth of\nmidpoint\nbelow\nsurface\n(metres)\nEstimated\ntrue width\n(metres)\nGold grade\n(g/t)\n(uncapped)\nGold\ngrade (g/t)\n(capped)*\nAMQ17-1607C\nWT\n746.1\n750.7\n673\n3.3\n8.5\n8.5\nAMQ18-1669A\nWT\n677.5\n681.5\n582\n2.8\n6.5\n6.5\nAMQ18-1677\nWT North\n603.1\n606.9\n540\n2.8\n31.8\n23.1\nincluding\n604.7\n605.8\n540\n0.8\n109.4\n79.2\nand\nWT North\n650.2\n654.3\n580\n2.9\n31.6\n18.6\nincluding\n652.0\n652.9\n580\n0.6\n139.0\n80.0\nand\nWT North\n671.3\n675.1\n598\n3.3\n16.6\n16.6\nand\nWT\n704.1\n712.0\n627\n7.2\n6.4\n6.4\nAMQ18-1677A\nWT\n715.1\n724.5\n641\n8.5\n13.8\n13.8\n*\nHoles at the Whale Tail deposit use a capping factor of 80 g/t gold.\n[Amaruq Project Local Geology Map]\n[Amaruq Project Composite Longitudinal Section]\nThe Whale Tail deposit has been defined over at least 2.3 kilometres of strike length and extends from surface to 915 metres depth.\nHole AMQ18-1677 is a significant recent deep hole that had multiple intercepts, including some narrow, very high grades between 540 and 627 metres depth. The first three intercepts were in quartz veins in ultramafic host rocks, in a parallel structure approximately 50 metres north of the iron formation that hosts the main Whale Tail mineralized zone, and included 23.1 g/t gold over 2.8 metres at 540 metres depth, 18.6 g/t gold over 2.9 metres at 580 metres depth and 16.6 g/t gold over 3.3 metres at 598 metres depth. A lower intercept from the same drill hole – 6.4 g/t gold over 7.2 metres at 627 metres depth – was in the main Whale Tail mineralized unit.\nThe parallel structure to the north of the main iron formation has the potential to improve the economics of the underground portion of the Whale Tail deposit. It will continue to be investigated while testing Whale Tail at depth.\nA branch from the same hole, numbered AMQ18-1677A, intersected 13.8 g/t gold over 8.5 metres at 641 metres depth. This intercept confirms the width of the model at this location within the mineral resources but at a grade higher than anticipated. Two new intercepts have encountered mineralization west of the current underground mineral resources, which is one of the goals of the 2018 exploration drill program. Hole AMQ18-1669A intersected 6.5 g/t gold over 2.8 metres at 582 metres depth, while AMQ17-1607C intersected 8.5 g/t gold over 3.3 metres at 673 metres depth. These intercepts extend the main Whale Tail mineralized unit to the west by approximately 130 metres from the current mineral resources, below 580 metres depth.\nThe Whale Tail deposit remains open at depth and along strike. The drill program for the remainder of 2018 will continue to test the Whale Tail deposit and the parallel structure to its north at depth, to expand the mineral resources and continue to convert inferred to indicated mineral resources. Drilling has also resumed in the V Zone to test its depth and lateral extent.\nMeliadine Project - Mine Development and Construction Schedule Progressing on Plan and on Budget\nLocated near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, Canada, the Meliadine project was acquired in July 2010, and is Agnico Eagle's largest gold deposit in terms of mineral resources. The Company owns 100% of the 111,757 hectare property.\nIn February 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved the construction of the Meliadine project. The mine was initially forecast to begin operations in the third quarter of 2019. However, given the progress of construction and development activities in 2017 and through the first quarter of 2018, the Company announced in February 2018 that the Meliadine project is expected to begin operations in the second quarter of 2019.\nThe forecast parameters surrounding the Company's proposed Meliadine operations were based on a preliminary economic assessment, which is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no certainty that the forecast production amounts will be realized. The basis for the preliminary economic assessment and the qualifications and assumptions made by the qualified person who undertook the preliminary economic assessment are set out in this news release and the Company's news release dated February 15, 2017. The results of the preliminary economic assessment had no impact on the results of any pre-feasibility or feasibility study in respect of Meliadine.\nExpected gold production for 2019 is estimated to be approximately 170,000 ounces. In 2020, expected production is approximately 385,000 ounces of gold. The Company is evaluating potential opportunities to increase production in 2019.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Meliadine property was estimated to contain proven and probable mineral reserves of 3.7 million ounces of gold (16.0 million tonnes grading 7.12 g/t gold), indicated mineral resources of 3.1 million ounces of gold (25.3 million tonnes grading 3.77 g/t gold) and inferred mineral resources of 2.7 million ounces of gold (13.8 million tonnes grading 6.04 g/t gold). In addition, there are numerous other known gold occurrences along the 80-kilometre-long greenstone belt that require further evaluation.\nFor additional technical details on the project see the Company's news release dated February 15, 2017.\n2018 Activities and Additional Opportunities to Create Value at Meliadine\nThe Meliadine project remains on budget with capital expenditures in 2018 forecast to be approximately $398 million. The 2019 project capital forecast is unchanged at approximately $130 million.\nRecent development/construction highlights include:\nMechanical/Piping/Electrical/Instrumentation (MPEI) is progressing as planned for both the process plant and power plant; limited mechanical equipment will be airlifted ahead of the barge season to continue to advance the construction schedule Commissioning of the process plant is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2019 The generators for the power plant are expected to be delivered to the site on the first sealift of 2018 in June The multiservice building (office, warehouse, maintenance) will be fully functional in the second quarter of 2018 Civil work for the paste and crusher plant are underway and will be ready for construction in the second quarter of 2018 The SAG mill components are on site and installation began in April 2018 In the first quarter of 2018, approximately 2,118 metres of lateral underground development was completed, which was slightly ahead of budget In the first quarter of 2018, approximately 5,500 metres of underground delineation drilling had been completed, which is in line with the budget. As a result, 90% of the stopes that will be developed in 2018 have been delineated. The delineation of 2019 stopes is progressing well Results from the delineation drilling have generally been in line with the block model The remaining procurement packages have now been awarded, with follow up for delivery on the 2018 sealift\nThe Company believes that there are numerous opportunities to create additional value at Meliadine, both at the mine and on the large land package. These include:\nOptimization of the current mine plan (advance Phase 2 pit implementation) Potential to optimize labour costs once the mine is in operation (via improved use of telecommunications) Minesite exploration upside through mineral resource conversion and expansion of known ore zones (most zones are open below a vertical depth of 450 metres) Potential for the discovery of new deposits along the 80 kilometre-long greenstone belt\nFINLAND AND SWEDEN\nAgnico Eagle's Kittila mine in Finland is the largest primary gold producer in Europe and hosts the Company's largest mineral reserves. Exploration activities continue to expand the mineral reserves and mineral resources and the Company has approved an expansion to add an underground shaft and increase expected mill throughput by 25 percent to 2.0 million tonnes per annum (\"mtpa\"). In Sweden, the Company has a 55% interest in the Barsele exploration project.\nKittila – Higher Throughout Partially Offsets Lower Grades and Recoveries\nThe 100% owned Kittila mine in northern Finland achieved commercial production in 2009.\nKittila Mine - Operating Statistics\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nTonnes of ore milled (thousands of tonnes)\n468\n423\nTonnes of ore milled per day\n5,204\n4,697\nGold grade (g/t)\n3.77\n4.29\nGold production (ounces)\n48,118\n51,621\nProduction costs per tonne (EUR)\n€\n75\n€\n78\nMinesite costs per tonne (EUR)\n€\n74\n€\n75\nProduction costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n888\n$\n696\nTotal cash costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n882\n$\n668\nProduction costs per tonne in the first quarter of 2018 decreased when compared to the prior-year period due to higher throughput levels. Production costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to the strengthening of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar between periods and lower production.\nMinesite costs per tonne in the first quarter of 2018 were essentially the same when compared to the prior-year period. Total cash costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to the strengthening of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar between periods and lower production.\nGold production in the first quarter of 2018 decreased when compared to the prior-year period due to lower grades and recoveries. In addition, a 10-day planned maintenance shutdown at the mill took place in April 2018. This shutdown was factored into the 2018 guidance.\nIn February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved an expansion to increase throughput rates at Kittila to 2.0 mtpa from the current rate of 1.6 mtpa. This expansion includes the construction of a 1,044 metre deep shaft, a processing plant expansion as well as other infrastructure and service upgrades.\nThis expansion project is expected to increase the efficiency of the mine and decrease or maintain current operating costs while providing access to the deeper mining horizons. In addition, the shaft is expected to provide access to the mineral resources located below 1,150 metres, where recent exploration programs have shown promising results. This expansion project remains on schedule and exploration drilling is ongoing to expand and infill the mineral reserve and mineral resource base at depth.\nSOUTHERN BUSINESS REVIEW\nAgnico Eagle's Southern Business operations are focused in Mexico. These operations have been a source of growing precious metals production (gold and silver), stable operating costs and strong free cash flow since 2009.\nPinos Altos – Advancement of Satellite Deposits is a Key Focus in 2018\nThe 100% owned Pinos Altos mine in northern Mexico achieved commercial production in November 2009.\nPinos Altos Mine - Operating Statistics\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nTonnes of ore processed (thousands of tonnes)\n519\n553\nTonnes of ore processed per day\n5,770\n6,149\nGold grade (g/t)\n2.62\n2.71\nGold production (ounces)\n41,836\n45,360\nProduction costs per tonne\n$\n67\n$\n43\nMinesite costs per tonne\n$\n61\n$\n48\nProduction costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n829\n$\n523\nTotal cash costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n539\n$\n358\nProduction costs per tonne in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to lower throughput, higher costs associated with underground mining and the timing of unsold inventory. Production costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to lower gold production, the strengthening of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar between periods and the reasons described above.\nMinesite costs per tonne in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to the reasons described above. Total cash costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to lower gold production, slightly lower by-product revenue, the strengthening of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar between periods and the reasons described above.\nGold production in the first quarter of 2018 decreased when compared to the prior-year period due to lower throughput and lower grades, however, throughput and grades are expected to improve over the balance of 2018 with resulting lower unit costs.\nIn 2018, Pinos Altos is transitioning into a predominantly underground mining operation, with associated higher costs, and limited open pit production. The development of satellite deposits provides an opportunity to lower unit costs by filling available capacity at the processing and heap leaching facility. Optimization opportunities are being studied to reduce unit costs\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, construction was completed on the Phase IV heap leach pad and ore stacking commenced. This pad will receive the remaining open pit ore being mined at Pinos Altos in 2018, and will have the capacity to process heap leach ore from other sources.\nA key focus in the first quarter of 2018 was on the continued advancement of the Sinter and Cubiro satellite deposits at Pinos Altos. The Sinter deposit will be mined from underground and a small open pit. At Sinter, tree clearing has been completed and permits have been received for open pit mining and underground ramp development. Construction of the portal and underground development activities are expected to begin in the second quarter of 2018, with initial production from Sinter expected to commence in the fourth quarter of this year.\nThe Cubiro deposit is an underground exploration opportunity, located immediately west of the Creston Mascota mine, which is envisioned to potentially produce high grade ore that will be trucked to the Pinos Altos processing facilities as early as in 2022. The access road is under construction with completion expected in July 2018. Portal and ramp development will be initiated once the access road is completed and 420 metres of underground development is planned for the fourth quarter of 2018. Underground exploration and delineation are expected to commence in early 2019.\nExploration in the First Quarter of 2018 Focused on Reyna de Plata Deposit\nThe Reyna de Plata deposit is an opportunity for another satellite source of ore on the Pinos Altos property, approximately 1,200 metres north of the Oberon de Weber pit. Exploration permits were received for the Reyna de Plata deposit in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a 5,000-metre drill program commenced in mid-January 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, exploration included 3,450 metres of infill drilling focused on converting inferred to indicated mineral resources within the current resources pit model.\nSelected recent drill results and drill hole collar coordinates are set out in the tables below. The collars are also located on the Pinos Altos Local Geology Map. All intercepts reported for the Reyna de Plata Zone show uncapped and capped gold and silver grades over estimated true widths, based on a preliminary geological interpretation that will be updated as new information becomes available with further drilling.\nRecent exploration drill results from the Reyna de Plata Deposit at the Pinos Altos mine\nDrill Hole\nFrom\n(metres)\nTo\n(metres)\nDepth of\nmidpoint\nbelow\nsurface\n(metres)\nEstimated\ntrue width\n(metres)\nGold grade\n(g/t)\n(uncapped)\nGold grade\n(g/t)\n(capped)\nSilver grade\n(g/t)\n(uncapped)\nSilver\ngrade (g/t)\n(capped)\nRP18-035\n2.2\n21.0\n16\n18.2\n0.9\n0.9\n39\n39\nRP18-038\n1.5\n12.0\n10\n9.5\n0.9\n0.9\n25\n25\nand\n20.4\n31.0\n35\n9.6\n3.0\n1.7\n27\n27\nand\n72.0\n75.5\n99\n3.2\n2.3\n2.3\n42\n42\nand\n81.6\n85.6\n112\n3.6\n9.6\n4.2\n164\n144\nRP18-039\n36.0\n61.3\n57\n22.9\n2.0\n2.0\n56\n53\nand\n78.0\n81.0\n97\n2.7\n3.8\n3.8\n44\n44\nRP18-043\n22.0\n41.5\n31\n17.7\n0.9\n0.9\n12\n12\nRP18-048\n76.3\n80.9\n78\n4.1\n8.4\n4.7\n55\n55\nand\n88.4\n92.7\n89\n3.9\n3.1\n2.5\n23\n23\nRP18-051\n20.9\n28.9\n31\n7.3\n1.2\n1.2\n42\n42\nand\n42.0\n47.2\n65\n4.7\n1.7\n1.7\n40\n40\nand\n60.9\n66.0\n84\n4.6\n1.6\n1.6\n34\n34\nCut-off value 0.30 g/t gold, maximum 3.0 metres internal dilution\nHoles at the Reyna de Plata zone use a capping factor of 10 g/t gold and 200 g/t silver.\nReyna de Plata Deposit at Pinos Altos mine exploration drill collar coordinates\nDrill collar coordinates*\nDrill Hole ID\nUTM North\nUTM East\nElevation (metres\nabove sea level)\nAzimuth\n(degrees)\nDip\n(degrees)\nLength\n(metres)\nRP18-035\n3131308\n765553\n2,038\n201\n-44\n147\nRP18-038\n3131334\n765481\n2,029\n200\n-46\n159\nRP18-039\n3131344\n765583\n2,000\n201\n-60\n147\nRP18-043\n3131417\n765328\n1,992\n201\n-45\n156\nRP18-048\n3131369\n765326\n2,033\n199\n-45\n141\nRP18-051\n3131364\n765478\n2,012\n201\n-46\n120\n*\nCoordinate System UTM Nad 27 Zone N12\n[Pinos Altos Local Geology Map]\nThe geological focus of the Pinos Altos property is a horst structure – which is an uplifted block of rocks – at least 10 kilometers long by 3 kilometers wide, defined by the Reyna de Plata Fault to the north and the Santo Niño Fault to the south. The Reyna de Plata deposit hosts inferred mineral resources of 110,000 ounces gold and 3.9 million ounces silver (5.8 million tonnes grading 0.59 g/t gold and 21.14 g/t silver) at open pit depth, as well as 93,000 ounces gold and 1.4 million ounces silver (1.2 million tonnes grading 2.35 g/t gold and 35.11 g/t silver) at underground depth. These inferred mineral resources formed part of the total Pinos Altos mineral resources estimate as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Reyna de Plata deposit lies along the Reyna de Plata Fault, as does the Sinter Zone 1,740 metres to the northwest. The Reyna de Plata deposit consists of low-sulphidation epithermal vein-style mineralization over a 2.5-kilometre strike length in an east-west direction. The gold and silver mineralization is accompanied by green-clear-white quartz and calcite in veins, stockwork and breccia.\nRecent drilling has yielded significant shallow intervals such as hole RP18-038 that intersected multiple mineralized intervals, including 1.7 g/t gold and 27 g/t silver over 9.6 metres at 35 metres depth and 4.2 g/t gold and 144 g/t silver over 3.6 metres at 112 metres depth. Approximately 100 metres to the east, hole RP18-039 intersected 2.0 g/t gold and 53 g/t silver over 22.9 metres at 57 metres depth and 3.8 g/t gold and 44 g/t silver over 2.7 metres at 97 metres depth. Approximately 270 metres to the northwest of the latter hole, hole RP18-043 intersected 0.9 g/t gold and 12 g/t silver over 17.7 metres at 31 metres depth. The results of this program are expected to increase the mineral resources and allow for the conversion to indicated mineral resources at Reyna de Plata in the year-end mineral resources estimate.\nDifferent mining options are currently being studied for the potential exploitation of the deposit.\nCreston Mascota – Mining Transitions to Bravo Deposit; Drilling Continues to Extend Mineralization at Madrono\nThe 100% owned Creston Mascota open pit heap leach, located less than 7 kilometres from Pinos Altos, has been operating since late 2010.\nCreston Mascota deposit at Pinos Altos - Operating Statistics\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nTonnes of ore processed (thousands of tonnes)\n475\n524\nTonnes of ore processed per day\n5,273\n5,817\nGold grade (g/t)\n0.67\n1.16\nGold production (ounces)\n11,988\n11,244\nProduction costs per tonne\n$\n20\n$\n13\nMinesite costs per tonne\n$\n22\n$\n13\nProduction costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n805\n$\n621\nTotal cash costs per ounce of gold produced ($ per ounce):\n$\n738\n$\n525\nProduction costs per tonne in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to fewer tonnes processed, higher contractor and maintenance costs and the timing of unsold inventory. Production costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to the strengthening of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar between periods and the reasons described above.\nMinesite costs per tonne in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to the reasons described above. Total cash costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to the strengthening of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar between periods and reasons described above.\nGold production in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to optimizations made to the leaching process, which resulted in faster initial recoveries from on-pad inventories when compared to the prior-year period. Silver recoveries also improved in the current period largely due to a finer crush size.\nIn 2018, the Creston Mascota pit will be transitioning to the Bravo pit, located immediately to the south. Higher costs are expected due to longer hauling distances and higher stripping volumes. Optimization opportunities are being studied to reduce unit costs. The development of satellite deposits provide an opportunity to extend mine life at the Creston Mascota heap leaching facility.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, work continued on the access road to the Bravo deposit (92% completed) and a new waste rock storage site has been located closer to the deposit, which is expected to reduce waste haulage costs. Initial mining activities have commenced at Bravo and it is expected to be the primary ore source at Creston Mascota for approximately the next two years.\nSoil removal at the Phase V heap leach pad was completed in March 2018, and the new pad is expected to be in operation in the third quarter of 2018.\nDrilling Continues to Expand Mineralized Zones at Madrono\nExploration at the high-grade Madrono Zone, immediately southeast of the Creston Mascota pit, began in early 2016, and to the end of 2017 a total of 33,045 metres (162 holes) had been drilled on the zone. The initial indicated mineral resources at the Madrono zone are 56,000 ounces gold and 863,000 ounces silver (858,000 tonnes grading 2.03 g/t gold and 31.26 g/t silver), all at underground depth. The Madrono zone also has inferred mineral resources of 144,000 ounces gold and 2.6 million ounces silver (1,941,000 tonnes grading 2.31 g/t gold and 40.97 g/t silver), all at underground depth. The Madrono zone's mineral resources formed part of the total Pinos Altos mineral resources estimate as of December 31, 2017.\nDrilling in the first quarter of 2018 totalled 5,073 metres of infill and exploration drilling in 24 holes. The Madrono zone is a potential satellite mining opportunity to provide mill feed to extend the mine life at Pinos Altos.\nDrilling results for Madrono were last reported in the Company's news release dated February 14, 2018.\nSelected recent drill results from the Madrono Zone and drill hole collar coordinates are set out in the tables below.

Total cash costs per ounce in the first quarter of 2018 increased when compared to the prior-year period due to lower gold production, lower by-product revenue and the strengthening of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar between periods.\nGold production in the first quarter of 2018 decreased when compared to the prior-year period due to lower recoveries.\nIn 2017, La India transitioned to mining the Main Zone by open pit. This zone has slower recoveries than the North Zone, which are being addressed with an optimization strategy to improve production and costs. The development of satellite deposits also provides an opportunity to extend mine life.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, several small modifications that are part of a broader optimization plan were completed to the La India heap leach process to improve gold production. Improvements included:\nAt the absorption, desorption and refining (\"ADR\") plant, two additional carbon columns were installed and commissioned in mid-March with positive results An additional carbon regeneration kiln has also been ordered with commissioning expected by June 2018 At the heap leach pad, ore stacking and irrigation plans have been optimized, which is expected to provide more effective leaching dynamics\nLa India Exploration Focused on Extending Near-Pit Mineralization and Other Near-Mine Targets\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, exploration drilling was predominately focused in the El Realito area to evaluate the potential to increase mineral resources in close proximity to the current mining areas. Drilling was also carried out on the Los Tubos Zone to explore northeast- and northwest-trending mineralized structures. Drilling results for the La India property were last reported in the Company's news release dated February 14, 2018.\nMine-site exploration at the La India property in the first quarter of 2018 included 2,665 metres (22 holes) at Los Tubos and 4,168 metres (27 holes) at El Realito, totalling 6,833 metres of the 25,000-metre budget in 2018. In addition, the regional exploration at the La India property in the first quarter of 2018 included mapping and surface sampling at Chipriona as well as metallurgical testing. Exploration and definition drilling of the Chipriona structure will resume in May.\nSelected recent drill results from the La India property and the drill hole collar coordinates are set out in the tables below. The collars are located on the La India Area Property and Location Map. The intercepts reported for the La India property show uncapped and capped gold and silver grades over estimated true widths, based on a preliminary geological interpretation that will be updated as new information becomes available with further drilling. The gold and silver grades for the Chipriona regional target are not capped as the project is at too early a stage to determine capping values.\nAdditional drilling is planned in the El Realito, Los Tubos, El Cochi, Main Zone, Chipriona and Tarachi areas over the remainder of 2018.\nRecent exploration drill results from the La India property\nDrill Hole\nVein\nFrom\n(metres)\nTo\n(metres)\nDepth of\nmidpoint\nbelow\nsurface\n(metres)\nEstimated\ntrue width\n(metres)\nGold\ngrade\n(g/t)\n(uncapped)\nGold\ngrade\n(g/t)\n(capped)\nSilver\ngrade\n(g/t)\n(uncapped)\nSilver\ngrade\n(g/t)\n(capped)\nINER18-125\nEl Realito\n74.5\n79.0\n86\n3.3\n1.6\n1.6\n21\n21\nand\nEl Realito\n124.0\n140.9\n134\n14.1\n2.4\n2.4\n3\n3\nincluding\n135.0\n139.0\n137\n3.2\n6.8\n6.8\n5\n5\nINER18-139\nEl Realito\n82.0\n90.1\n56\n7.2\n3.4\n3.1\n15\n15\nCHP17-010\nChipriona\n25.5\n44.5\n25\n14.3\n0.5\n-\n15\n-\nincluding\n33.0\n38.0\n25\n3.8\n1.1\n-\n32\n-\nCHP17-012\nChipriona\n0.0\n24.0\n10\n18.0\n0.6\n-\n216\n-\nincluding\n17.0\n22.3\n19\n4.0\n1.5\n-\n813\n-\nCHP17-013\nChipriona\n96.0\n107.0\n103\n8.3\n0.9\n-\n407\n-\nCHP17-014\nChipriona\n67.0\n95.0\n68\n21.0\n0.5\n-\n18\n-\nincluding\n67.0\n74.0\n59\n5.3\n0.8\n-\n30\n-\nCHP17-016\nChipriona\n14.0\n24.0\n20\n7.5\n0.6\n-\n82\n-\nCHP17-019\nChipriona\n0.0\n78.0\n38\n58.5\n0.6\n-\n21\n-\nincluding\n19.0\n27.0\n23\n6.0\n1.8\n-\n70\n-\nCHP17-021\nChipriona\n45.8\n49.8\n22\n3.0\n0.6\n-\n137\n-\nand\nChipriona\n125.0\n159.5\n114\n24.6\n0.5\n-\n60\n-\nincluding\n145.0\n151.0\n117\n4.5\n0.7\n-\n137\n-\nCHP17-024\nChipriona\n242.0\n264.0\n214\n16.5\n2.3\n-\n24\n-\nincluding\n250.0\n256.0\n212\n4.5\n7.5\n-\n20\n-\nCHP17-026\nChipriona\n18.3\n32.0\n11\n10.3\n1.0\n-\n9\n-\nCHP17-027\nChipriona\n12.0\n57.4\n22\n33.0\n0.4\n-\n120\n-\nincluding\n47.0\n52.5\n35\n3.1\n1.0\n-\n684\n-\nCHP17-028\nChipriona\n57.0\n61.5\n27\n3.4\n0.2\n-\n269\n-\nand\nChipriona\n122.5\n127.0\n48\n3.4\n4.1\n-\n66\n-\nand\nChipriona\n182.8\n188.0\n80\n3.9\n1.2\n-\n21\n-\nand\nChipriona\n314.5\n320.0\n127\n4.1\n1.2\n-\n57\n-\nCHP17-035\nChipriona\n1.5\n76.6\n37\n56.3\n0.9\n-\n34\n-\nincluding\n23.0\n61.5\n40\n28.9\n1.4\n-\n40\n-\nCHP17-036\nChipriona\n0.0\n37.5\n20\n28.1\n0.7\n-\n170\n-\nincluding\n0.0\n10.1\n5\n7.6\n1.8\n-\n370\n-\nHoles at the La India property, including the El Realito Zone, use a capping factor of 10 g/t gold and 200 g/t silver.

Initial indicated mineral resources have been declared at El Realito of 112,000 ounces gold and 642,000 ounces silver (5.0 million tonnes grading 0.70 g/t gold and 4.00 g/t silver); inferred mineral resources are 18,000 ounces gold and 97,000 ounces silver (1.4 million tonnes grading 0.40 g/t gold and 2.20 g/t silver). The mineral resources at El Realito formed part of the total mineral resources estimate for La India as of December 31, 2017.\nThe El Realito mineralization is found in northeast-striking subvertical parallel structural corridors of breccia that appear to have acted as conduits, bringing gold and silver mineralization into the favourable subhorizontal volcanic rock layers (the lower porphyritic dacite).\nAn infill drill program is underway at El Realito, with some holes being extended to explore areas outside the current mineral resources. An example of this is hole INER18-125 that intersected 1.6 g/t gold and 21 g/t silver over 3.3 metres at 86 metres depth, followed by 2.4 g/t gold and 3 g/t silver over 14.1 metres at 134 metres depth, including 6.8 g/t gold and 5 g/t silver over 3.2 metres. This hole extends both the subvertical and the subhorizontal mineralization approximately 50 metres to the southwest.\nApproximately 600 metres to the northeast, hole INER18-139 intersected 3.1 g/t gold and 15 g/t silver over 7.2 metres at 56 metres depth. Previous mineralization encountered in this area grades lower than this and was mostly in subhorizontal layers, whereas this mineralization is thought to be related to the subvertical feeder zone. El Realito remains open to the northeast and southwest.\nChipriona Zone; Indications of Sulphide Potential\nThe Chipriona satellite target is located approximately one kilometre north of the North Zone at the La India mine. Agnico Eagle acquired its 100% interest in the Chipriona property in December 2016. Mineralization at Chipriona consists of what appears to be structurally controlled gold- and silver-rich veins, stringers and breccia with significant sulphide zinc, lead and copper content. Metallurgical testing will be conducted to determine the potential processing and cut-off grades for this type of mineralization. A diamond drill program on Chipriona began in the second quarter of 2017 and 8,582 metres (38 holes) were completed last year. Results of the initial holes were reported in the Company's news release dated September 5, 2017. Selected results from the remainder of the program are included in this new release.\nInitial results at Chipriona have been encouraging. Surface mapping and sampling have traced stacked structures within the Chipriona mineralized corridor that has a width ranging from tens of metres to a few hundred metres over a northwest strike length of at least 2,000 metres; 1,200 metres of this length has been confirmed through drill-testing. Mineralization has been intersected from surface to a depth of 214 metres. The project hosts a swarm of parallel and subparallel structural pathways that are favourable hosts for sulphide-based gold-silver mineralization with base metal credits. Significant mineralization has been intersected near surface over substantial widths; this suggests the potential for bulk mining lower-grade mineralization in stockwork zones that surround high-grade feeder zones. The gold and silver grades reported at Chipriona are uncapped.\nThe strongest intercept to date at Chipriona is also the deepest. In the southeast part of the zone, hole CHP17-024 intersected 2.3 g/t gold and 24 g/t silver over 16.5 metres at 214 metres depth, including 7.5 g/t gold and 20 g/t silver over 4.5 metres. Close to surface in the same area, hole CHP17-012 intersected 0.6 g/t gold and 216 g/t silver over 18.0 metres at 10 metres depth, including 1.5 g/t gold and 813 g/t silver over 4.0 metres.\nApproximately 300 metres to the southeast, hole CHP17-035 intersected 0.9 g/t gold and 34 g/t silver over 56.3 metres at 37 metres depth, including 1.4 g/t gold and 40 g/t silver over 28.9 metres. In the same vicinity, hole CHP17-028 intersected 0.2 g/t gold and 269 g/t silver over 3.4 metres at 27 metres depth, as well as 4.1 g/t gold and 66 g/t silver over 3.4 metres at 48 metres depth.\nApproximately 1,000 metres to the northwest, hole CHP17-036 intersected 0.7 g/t gold and 170 g/t silver over 28 metres at 20 metres depth, including 1.8 g/t gold and 370 g/t silver over 7.6 metres.\nThe mineralized system remains open along strike, and shows significant potential at depth; parallel mineralized structures show Chipriona-like potential. Definition drilling is expected to start soon to look at opportunities for either bulk-mineable or high-grade areas in the known portion of the zone. Exploration drilling will test for extensions of the mineralized system.\nAbout Agnico Eagle\nAgnico Eagle is a senior Canadian gold mining company that has produced precious metals since 1957. Its eight mines are located in Canada, Finland and Mexico, with exploration and development activities in each of these countries as well as in the United States and Sweden. The Company and its shareholders have full exposure to gold prices due to its long-standing policy of no forward gold sales. Agnico Eagle has declared a cash dividend every year since 1983.\nNote Regarding Certain Measures of Performance\nThis news release discloses certain measures, including \"total cash costs per ounce\", \"all-in sustaining costs per ounce\", \"minesite costs per tonne\" and \"adjusted net income\" that are not standardized measures under IFRS. These data may not be comparable to data reported by other issuers. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial information reported in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, other than adjusted net income, see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures\" below.\nThe total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is reported on both a by-product basis (deducting by-product metal revenues from production costs) and co-product basis (before by-product metal revenues). The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis is calculated by adjusting production costs as recorded in the consolidated statements of income for by-product revenues, unsold concentrate inventory production costs, smelting, refining and marketing charges and other adjustments, and then dividing by the number of ounces of gold produced. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis, except that no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. Accordingly, the calculation of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis does not reflect a reduction in production costs or smelting, refining and marketing charges associated with the production and sale of by-product metals. The total cash costs per ounce of gold produced is intended to provide information about the cash-generating capabilities of the Company's mining operations. Management also uses this measure to monitor the performance of the Company's mining operations. As market prices for gold are Quote: d on a per ounce basis, using the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis measure allows management to assess a mine's cash-generating capabilities at various gold prices.\nThe Company calculates all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis as the aggregate of total cash costs on a by-product basis, sustaining capital expenditures (including capitalized exploration), general and administrative expenses (including stock options) and reclamation expenses, and then dividing by the number of ounces of gold produced. The all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a co-product basis is calculated in the same manner as the all-in sustaining costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis, except that the total cash costs on a co-product basis are used, meaning no adjustment is made for by-product metal revenues. All-in sustaining costs per ounce is used to show the full cost of gold production from current operations. Management is aware that these per ounce measures of performance can be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and, in the case of total cash costs per ounce of gold produced on a by-product basis, by-product metal prices. Management compensates for these inherent limitations by using these measures in conjunction with minesite costs per tonne (discussed below) as well as other data prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nMinesite costs per tonne are calculated by adjusting production costs as recorded in the consolidated statements of income for unsold concentrate inventory production costs, and then dividing by tonnes of ore processed. As the total cash costs per ounce of gold produced can be affected by fluctuations in by‑product metal prices and foreign exchange rates, management believes that minesite costs per tonne provides additional information regarding the performance of mining operations, eliminating the impact of varying production levels. Management also uses this measure to determine the economic viability of mining blocks. As each mining block is evaluated based on the net realizable value of each tonne mined, in order to be economically viable the estimated revenue on a per tonne basis must be in excess of the minesite costs per tonne. Management is aware that this per tonne measure of performance can be impacted by fluctuations in processing levels and compensates for this inherent limitation by using this measure in conjunction with production costs prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nAdjusted net income is calculated by adjusting the basic net income per share as recorded in the consolidated statements of income for foreign currency translation gains and losses, mark-to-market adjustments, non-recurring gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments. Management uses adjusted net income to evaluate the underlying operating performance of the Company and to assist with the planning and forecasting of future operating results. Management believes that adjusted net income is a useful measure of performance because foreign currency translation gains and losses, mark-to-market adjustments, non-recurring gains and losses and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments do not reflect the underlying operating performance of the Company and may not be indicative of future operating results.\nManagement also performs sensitivity analyses in order to quantify the effects of fluctuating foreign exchange rates and metal prices. This news release also contains information as to estimated future total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs per ounce and minesite costs per tonne. The estimates are based upon the total cash costs per ounce, all-in sustaining costs per ounce and minesite costs per tonne that the Company expects to incur to mine gold at its mines and projects and, consistent with the reconciliation of these actual costs referred to above, do not include production costs attributable to accretion expense and other asset retirement costs, which will vary over time as each project is developed and mined. It is therefore not practicable to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable IFRS measure.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information in this news release has been prepared as at April 26, 2018.
